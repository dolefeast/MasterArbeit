# Vacuum polarization in curved space time

## Description

In this project we study the properties of the vacuum under a curved space time through back reaction. For this we will start using a toy model in 1+1 dimensions, in which a (classical) electric field is applied to the vacuum state of a charged scalar field. This electric field will polarize the field and a new electric field is going to be generated, which will of course affect the existing scalar field. Introducing this new electric field in the differential equation that governs our field.
