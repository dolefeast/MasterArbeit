  abstract     = {We study the effect of boundary conditions on vacuum polarization for charged scalar fields in two space-time dimensions. We find that both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions lead to screening. In the Dirichlet case, the vacuum polarization charge density vanishes at the boundary, whereas it attains its maximum there for Neumann boundary conditions. At a critical field strength, the vacuum polarization diverges for Neumann boundary conditions, an effect due to the instability of the lowest energy mode in the presence of the external field.},

We show that it follows from a condition on the support of the Fourier transform of the corresponding positive frequency solution. Using a Krein space formalism, we establish an analogous result in the Klein-Gordon case for a wide class of smooth potentials. Finally, we investigate overcritical potentials, i.e. which admit no ground states. It turns out, that numerous Hadamard states can be constructed by mimicking the construction of ground states, but this leads to a naturally distinguished one only under more restrictive assumptions on the potentials.},

Several deficiencies in the popular prescription due to Schwinger and the mode sum formula for static external potentials are pointed out.

As a concrete example, we discuss vacuum polarization and the stress-energy tensor for massless fermions in 1+1 dimension. Also a general formula for the vacuum polarization in static external potentials in 3+1 dimensions is derived.},

An axiomatic approach is taken. We list five conditions which the renormalized stress-energy operatorTμvshould satisfy in order to give a reasonable semiclassical theory. It is proven that these conditions uniquely determineTμv, i.e. there is at most one renormalized stress-energy operator which satisfies all the conditions. We investigate existence by examining an explicit “point-splitting” type prescription for renormalizingTμv. Modulo some standard assumptions which are made in defining the prescription forTμv, it is shown that this prescription satisfies at least four of the five axioms.},

  abstract = {The question, “What happens to the electron orbitals as the charge of the nucleus is increased without bounds?” has inspired much of the interest in the description of particles bound strongly by external fields. Interest in this problem and in the related Klein paradox extends back nearly to the beginnings of relativistic quantum mechanics. However, the correct interpretation of the theory for overcritical potentials, where the parts of the complete set of single particle solutions associated with particles and antiparticles are no longer distinct, was given only recently. The understanding of the spectrum of the Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations is essential in order to obtain an appropriate physical description with quantum field theory. The strong binding by more than twice the rest mass of the particles in overcritical external potentials leads to qualitatively new effects. In the case of fermions we find spontaneous positron emission accompanied by creation of a charged lowest energy state, i.e. a charged vacuum. The number of positrons produced spontaneously is limited by the Pauli exclusion principle. For bosons we find that depending on the character of the external potential, either neutral or charged Bose condensates develop. While the questions associated with the meson fields seem academic at the moment, the effects attributed to the fermion field stand a good chance of being tested in an experiment in the near future. It is expected that in heavy ion collisions such as uranium on uranium near the Coulomb barrier overcritical electromagnetic fields will be created.},

Rather than a review, this is a personal account on the development of 30 years of this branch of physical science. Extensive analysis of the currently available information appears to us as revealing a global coherence among the astrophysical, cosmological, and fundamental physics data, or, at least, no evident need so far of substantial modification of our present understanding. Deeper data from future experiments will verify to what extent and in which directions this conclusion should be modified.},

abstract = {The Hubble constant H0 and matter density Ωm of the universe are measured using the latest γ-ray attenuation results from Fermi-LAT and Cerenkov telescopes. This methodology is based upon the fact that the extragalactic background light supplies opacity for very high energy photons via photon–photon interaction. The amount of γ-ray attenuation along the line of sight depends on the expansion rate and matter content of the universe. This novel strategy results in a value of  km s−1 Mpc−1 and . These estimates are independent and complementary to those based on the distance ladder, cosmic microwave background (CMB), clustering with weak lensing, and strong lensing data. We also produce a joint likelihood analysis of our results from γ-rays and those from more mature methodologies, excluding the CMB, yielding a combined value of H0 = 66.6 ± 1.6 km s−1 Mpc−1 and Ωm = 0.29 ± 0.02.}
