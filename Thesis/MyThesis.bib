We find that both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions lead to screening. In the Dirichlet case, the vacuum polarization charge density vanishes at the boundary, whereas it attains its maximum there for Neumann boundary conditions. At a critical field strength, the vacuum polarization diverges for Neumann boundary conditions, an effect due to the instability of the lowest energy mode in the presence of the external field.},

An axiomatic approach is taken. We list five conditions which the renormalized stress-energy operator Tμv should satisfy in order to give a reasonable semiclassical theory. It is proven that these conditions uniquely determine Tμv, i.e. there is at most one renormalized stress-energy operator which satisfies all the conditions. We investigate existence by examining an explicit “point-splitting” type prescription for renormalizing Tμv. Modulo some standard assumptions which are made in defining the prescription for Tμv, it is shown that this prescription satisfies at least four of the five axioms.},

  abstract = {The question, “What happens to the electron orbitals as the charge of the nucleus is increased without bounds?” has inspired much of the interest in the description of particles bound strongly by external fields. Interest in this problem and in the related Klein paradox extends back nearly to the beginnings of relativistic quantum mechanics. However, the correct interpretation of the theory for overcritical potentials, where the parts of the complete set of single particle solutions associated with particles and antiparticles are no longer distinct, was given only recently. The understanding of the spectrum of the Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations is essential in order to obtain an appropriate physical description with quantum field theory. The strong binding by more than twice the rest mass of the particles in overcritical external potentials leads to qualitatively new effects. In the case of fermions we find spontaneous positron emission accompanied by creation of a charged lowest energy state, i.e. a charged vacuum. The number of positrons produced spontaneously is limited by the Pauli exclusion principle. For bosons we find that depending on the character of the external potential, either neutral or charged Bose condensates develop. While the questions associated with the meson fields seem academic at the moment, the effects attributed to the fermion field stand a good chance of being tested in an experiment in the near future. It is expected that in heavy ion collisions such as uranium on uranium near the Coulomb barrier overcritical electromagnetic fields will be created.},

The amount of γ-ray attenuation along the line of sight depends on the expansion rate and matter content of the universe. This novel strategy results in a value of  km s−1 Mpc−1 and . These estimates are independent and complementary to those based on the distance ladder, cosmic microwave background (CMB), clustering with weak lensing, and strong lensing data. We also produce a joint likelihood analysis of our results from γ-rays and those from more mature methodologies, excluding the CMB, yielding a combined value of H0 = 66.6 ± 1.6 km s−1 Mpc−1 and Ωm = 0.29 ± 0.02.}

Results in micro-local analysis such as the propagation of singularities theorem and the uniqueness up to C∞ of distinguished parametrices are employed in the proof. We include a review of Kay and Wald's rigorous definition of the global Hadamard condition and the theory of distinguished parametrices, specializing to the case of the Klein-Gordon operator on a globally hyperbolic space-time. As an alternative to a recent computation of the wave front set of a globally Hadamard two-point distribution on a globally hyperbolic curved space-time, given elsewhere by Köhler (to correct an incomplete computation in [32]), we present a version of this computation that does not use a deformation argument such as that used in Fulling, Narcowich, and Wald and is independent of the Cauchy evolution argument of Fulling, Sweeny, and Wald (both of which are relied upon in Köhler's proof). This leads to a simple micro-local proof of the preservation of Hadamard form under Cauchy evolution (first shown by Fulling, Sweeny, and Wald) relying only on the propagation of singularities theorem. In another paper [33], the equivalence theorem is used to prove a conjecture by Kay that a locally Hadamard quasi-free Klein-Gordon state on any globally hyperbolic curved space-time must be globally Hadamard.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the study of quasifree states of a linear, scalar quantum field in globally hyperbolic spacetimes possessing a one-parameter group of isometries with a bifurcate Killing horizon. Some results on the uniqueness and thermal properties of such states are well known in the special cases of Minkowski, Schwarzschild, and deSitter spacetimes, and our main aim is to present new stronger results and to generalize them to this wide class of spacetimes. As a preliminary to proving our theorems, we develop some aspects of the theory of globally of hyperbolic spacetimes with a bifurcate Killing horizon, we give some new results on the structure of Bose quasifree states of linear fields (the class which includes all the usual “Fock vacua”), and we clarify and further develop the notion of a “Hadamard state”. We then consider the quasifre e states on these spacetimes which have vanishing one-point function, are invariant under the one-parameter isometry group, and are nonsingular in a neighborhood of the horizon in the sense that their two-point function is of the Hadamard form there. We prove that, on a large subalgebra of observables (which are determined by observables localized in compact regions of the horizon) such states are unique and pure. Furthermore, if the spacetime admits a certain discrete “wedge reflection” isometry (as holds automatically in the analytic case) we prove that this state - if it exists - must be a KMS state at the Hawking temperature T=κ/2π when restricted to those observables in our subalgebra which are localized in one of the (“right” or “left”) wedges of the spacetime where the Killing orbits are timelike near the horizon. Here, κ denotes the surface g ravity of the horizon. Under the further assumption that the nonsingularity of the state holds globally and that there are no “zero modes” in the one-partic le Hilbert space belonging to the state, we extend the uniqueness result to all observables localized in the full “domain of determinacy” of the hori zon. However, existence of states satisfying the hypotheses of our theorems does not hold in general and, indeed, we prove the nonexistence of any stationary (not necessarily quasifree) Hadamard state on the Schwarzschild-deSitter and Kerr spacetimes. We remark that nowhere in the analysis do we need to assume any form of Einstein's equations.}

abstract = {We have measured the running of the effective QED coupling constant α(s) in the time-like region 0.6<s<0.975 GeV with the KLOE detector at DAΦNE using the Initial-State Radiation process e+e−→μ+μ−γ. It represents the first measurement of the running of α(s) in this energy region. Our results show a more than 5σ significance of the hadronic contribution to the running of α(s), which is the strongest direct evidence both in time- and space-like regions achieved in a single measurement. By using the e+e−→π+π− cross section measured by KLOE, the real and imaginary parts of the shift Δα(s) have been extracted. From a fit of the real part of Δα(s) and assuming the lepton universality the branching ratio BR(ω→μ+μ−)=(6.6±1.4stat±1.7syst)⋅10−5 has been determined.}

  abstract  = {Quantum fields propagating on a curved spacetime are investigated in terms of microlocal analysis. We discuss a condition on the wave front set for the correspondingn-point distributions, called “microlocal spectrum condition” (μSC). On Minkowski space, this condition is satisfied as a consequence of the usual spectrum condition. Based on Radzikowski's determination of the wave front set of the two-point function of a free scalar field, satisfying the Hadamard condition in the Kay and Wald sense, we construct in the second part of this paper all Wick polynomials including the energy-momentum tensor for this field as operator valued distributions on the manifold and prove that they satisfy our “microlocal spectrum condition”.}

    abstract = {The ‘Magnificent Seven’ (M7) are a group of radio-quiet isolated neutron stars discovered in the soft X-rays through their purely thermal surface emission. Owing to the large inferred magnetic fields (B ≈ 1013 G), radiation from these sources is expected to be substantially polarized, independently of the mechanism actually responsible for the thermal emission. A large observed polarization degree (PD) is, however, expected only if quantum-electrodynamic (QED) polarization effects are present in the magnetized vacuum around the star. The detection of a strong linearly polarized signal would therefore provide the first observational evidence of QED effects in the strong-field regime. While polarization measurements in the soft X-rays are not feasible yet, optical polarization measurements are within reach also for quite faint targets, like the M7 which have optical counterparts with magnitudes ≈26–28. Here, we report on the measurement of optical linear polarization for the prototype, and brightest member, of the class, RX J1856.5−3754 (V ∼ 25.5), the first ever for one of the M7, obtained with the Very Large Telescope. We measured a PD = 16.43 ± 5.26 per cent and a polarization position angle PA = 145\$\_\{.\}^\{\\circ\}\$39 ± 9\$\_\{.\}^\{\\circ\}\$44, computed east of the North Celestial Meridian. The PD that we derive is large enough to support the presence of vacuum birefringence, as predicted by QED.},
