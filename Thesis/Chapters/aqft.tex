%\paragraph{Schrödinger vs. Heisenberg picture}
%In non-relativistic quantum mechanics (this can also be done in QFT, but it is non-standard), the usual way of studying solutions to the Schrödinger equation is using the Schrödinger picture.
%The Schrödinger picture means that solutions to the Schrödinger equation 
%\begin{align}
%	i\hbar \partial_t \psi(t, \textbf{x}) = H \psi(t, \textbf{x})
%\end{align}
%evolve in time as follows 
%\begin{align}
%	\psi(t, \textbf{x}) = e^{-iH (t-t_0)} \psi(t_0, \textbf{x}),
%\end{align}
%i.e. it focuses in the study of the time evolution of the wave function, where the operators remain "constant" in time. In this picture, the evaluation expectation values of some observable in the Schrödinger picture $\mathcal{O}_S$ and its evolution in time goes as 
%\begin{align}
%	\bra{\phi(t, \textbf{x})} \mathcal{O}_S \ket{\phi(t, \textbf{x})}  = 
%	\bra{\phi(t_0, \textbf{x})} e^{iH(t-t_0)} \mathcal{O}_S e^{-iH(t-t_0)} \ket{\phi(t_0, \textbf{x})} .
%	\label{eq:time-evolution-in-the-schrodinger-picture}
%\end{align}
%One might equivalently work in the Heisenberg picture, in which the study focuses on the time evolution of the operators, and the vectors are time-independent. By observing \eqref{eq:time-evolution-in-the-schrodinger-picture}, the operator $\mathcal{O}$ in the Heisenberg picture is defined as 
%\begin{align}
%	\mathcal{O}_H = e^{iH(t-t_0)} O_S e^{-iH(t-t_0)},
%\end{align}
%and differentiation of this expression with respect to time yields the equivalent time evolution equation for the operator $\mathcal{O}$ in the Heisenberg equation 
%\begin{align}
%		\frac{d\mathcal{O}_H}{dt} = i[H, \mathcal{O}_H].
%\end{align}
%

%When solved with compactly supported Cauchy data $\left(\left. \phi\right|_\Sigma, \left. n^{\mu}D_\mu\phi \right|_\Sigma\right)$, with $\Sigma$ a space-like hypersurface (typically a constant-$t$ surface) and $n$ a unit vector orthogonal to $\Sigma$, the global hyperbolicity of Minkowski spacetime ensures that this problem is well posed.
%		The collection of all possible smooth $\phi$ with compactly supported Cauchy data forms the configuration space $\mathcal{C}$. From $\mathcal{C}$ one constructs the phase space $\mathcal{P} = T^*\mathcal{C}$, as its cotangent space. The elements of $\mathcal{P}$ are the points $(\phi, \pi)$, with $\pi=D_0^*\phi^*$ the canonical conjugate of the field $\phi$. Points in the phase space correspond to initial conditions for the Klein-Gordon equation on the Cauchy surface $\Sigma.$
%		$\mathcal{P}$ can be endowed with symplectic structure with the symplectic\footnote{Bilinear, antisymmetric} form
%		\begin{align}
%			\sigma((\phi_1, \pi_1), (\phi_2, \pi_2)) = i \int_\Sigma \left( \pi_1^* \phi_2^*- \pi_2\phi_1 \right) d\Sigma.
%		\end{align}
%		It is not difficult to prove that $\sigma$ is a time evolution invariant if $\phi_1$, $\phi_2$ are solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation, as long as they are compactly supprted. \note{Prove this? In appendix?}
%	
%The solution space  $\mathcal{S}$ is the space of all smooth solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation. As the initial data fully determines a solution to the Klein-Gordon equation, each solution corresponds to a point in phase space and therefore $\mathcal{S}$ can be identified with $\mathcal{P}$.
%$\mathcal{S}$ can be given Hilbert space structure as follows: 
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Define the subspace $\mathcal{S}_+$ of positive frequency solutions. In this subspace the symplectic product can be made positive definite.
%	\item Define a Hermitian inner product in this subspace 
%	\begin{align}
%		(\phi_1, \phi_2) = i\sigma(\phi_1^*, \phi_2), \,\,\, \phi_1, \phi_2 \in S_{+}
%	\end{align}
%\item Complete $\mathcal{S}_+$ with respect to this norm. \note{How to go from this to the whole $\mathcal{S}$?}
%\end{enumerate}
%	
%
%In classical mechanics, observables are the compactly supported functions \linebreak $f: \mathcal{S}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. They can be equipped with an algebra structure via the Poisson brackets, 
%\begin{align}
%\{f, g\}  := \int_{\Sigma}^{}  \left( \frac{\delta f}{\delta \phi} \frac{\delta g}{\delta \pi} - \frac{\delta g}{\delta \phi} \frac{\delta f}{\delta \pi}  \right) d\Sigma.
%\end{align}
%
%First quantisation is done by the\, $\hat{}$\, operator, which elevates classical observables $f$ to operators $\hat{f}$ on the $\mathcal{S}$ obeying the algebraic rule 
%\begin{align}
%	[ \hat{f}, \hat{g} ] = i \hat{\{f, g\} },
%\end{align}
%with $ \hat{\{f, g\} }$ the quantized version of the Poisson bracket.
%
%The field observables are defined with respect to smooth compactly supported test functions $f$
%\begin{align}
%	\phi(f) = a(f)e^{-i\omega t} + a^\dagger(\overline{f}) e^{i\omega t},
%\end{align}
%where the $a$ and $a^\dagger$ operators are defined the same way the are constructed in the quantum harmonic oscillator problem. 
%
%The measured observables of the field in a state $\Omega \in \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{S)}$ are therefore the expectation value $ \bra{\Omega} \phi(f) \ket{\Omega}$.
%Through $\phi(f)$ one can define the field as the weighted average by the test function $f$ of the spacetime distribution $\phi(x)$ through 
%\begin{align}
%	\phi (f) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}^{} \phi(x) f(x) d^{n}x,
%\end{align}
%with $\phi(x)$ an operator valued distribution.
%This also formally defines the two-point function as the distributional kernel of
%\begin{align}
%	w^{\phi\phi^*}_\Omega(f, h) 
%	= \bra{\Omega} \phi(f)\phi^*(g) \ket{\Omega}  
%	= \int_{\mathcal{M}\times \mathcal{M}}  f(x) g(x') w^{\phi\phi^*}_\Omega(x, x') dx dx'.
%	\label{eq:two-point-function-formal-definition}
%\end{align}



%\textbf{Requirements}: The GNS construction, the definition of state.
%
%Given an algebra of observables $\mathcal{A}$, an algebraic state $\omega$ is defined as the linear map $\omega: \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{C}$ which obeys (certain properties: unitarity, positive definite, some more).  Given two elements $f, h$ of the phase space, the two point function of a state is defined as 
%\begin{align}
%	w(f, h) = \omega(\sigma_f \sigma_h).
%\end{align} 
%One can also define the kernel $w(x, x')$ of the two point function (which will also be called the two point function) through 
%\begin{align}
%w(f, h) = \int_{\mathcal{M} \times \mathcal{M}}^{} w(x, x') f(x) g(x') dx dx'
%\end{align}

%\section{The basic idea}
%
%\note{This is the basic idea. A lot of concepts need to be introduced before this.}
%
%\ldots therefore fields are to be understood as smeared operators over some test function, as
%\begin{align}
%	\phi(f) = \int_{\mathcal{M} }^{}  \phi(x) f(x) dx.
%\end{align}

%\section{Things that might be useful in this chapter}
%
%The quantities involved in the currents $T_{\mu \nu}$ or $j^\mu$ are all of the form 
%\begin{align}
%	\left(
%	D_\alpha \phi
%	\right) ^* D_\beta \phi,
%\end{align}
%with $\alpha, \beta$ two symmetrized multiindices. Terms with more derivatives are `more singular'.
%
%To calculate the expectation value of this operator, we begin by assuming as Dirac did \cite{Dirac1934}, that all physically relevant states are Hadamard. Namely that their two point functions with respect to a state $\Omega$
%\begin{align}
%	w^{\phi \phi^*}_\Omega(x, x') = \bra{\Omega}\phi(x) \phi^*(x')\ket{\Omega}
%\end{align}
%have the same singularity structure with $x' \to x$ as it would on a flat background.  More precisely, this two point function can be written in the form
%\begin{align}
%	w^{\phi \phi^*}_\Omega(x, x') = H^{\phi \phi^*}(x, x')+ R_\Omega^{\phi \phi^*}(x, x'),
%\end{align}
%with $H^{\phi \phi ^*}$ the Hadamard parametrix, and $R_\Omega ^{\phi\phi^*}$ a smooth function as $x' \to x$.  The Hadamard parametrix is singular as $x' \to x$, and it is state independent
%\footnote{Conversation with Rishabh (19/7/24): An incorrect renormalization scheme induces gauge dependent results, as what we are interested in is the $R_\Omega^{\phi\phi^*}$. Note that assuming Hadamard states, the gauge dependence of both $\omega_\Omega$ and $H$ cancels out when substracted.}.
%
%The assumption of the state being Hadamard allows us to define the expectation value of the quadratic expression of interest following a point-splitting scheme, i.e. splitting the point at which we want to evaluate the expectation value, and taking the limit of coinciding points,
%\begin{align}
%	\bra{\Omega} D_\alpha\phi(x)(D_\beta\phi)^*(x)\ket{\Omega} :=
%	\lim_{x'\to x }\left[ D_\alpha D'_\beta^*\left( 
%	w^{\phi \phi^*}_\Omega(x, x') - H^{\phi \phi^*}(x, x')
%	\right)  \right].
%	\label{eq:point-split}
%\end{align}
% $\alpha, \beta$ are symmetrized multiindices and $D'_\mu^* = \partial'_\mu - ieA_\mu$ the application of the covariant derivative on $x'$.
%Substracting the state independent singular part of the Hadamard parametrix from the two point function yields the evaluation of the regular function $R_\Omega^{\phi \phi^*}$.
%
%For the massless case \note{Still need to calculate the leading order expansion for the massive case}, the Hadamard parametrix is
%\begin{align}
%	H^{\phi \phi^*}(x, x') = U(x, x') \log \left( - (x - x')^2 + i\epsilon (x - x')^{0} \right) ,
%\end{align}
%with $U(x, x')$ a smooth function given by the parallel transport with respect to the gauge covariant derivative 
%\begin{align}
%	U(x, x') = \exp(-ie  \int_{0}^{1} A_\mu (x' + s(x -x')) (x-x')^{\mu}ds).
%\end{align}
