  title        = {Vacuum polarization near boundaries},
  abstract     = {We study the effect of boundary conditions on vacuum polarization for charged scalar fields in two space-time dimensions. We find that both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions lead to screening. In the Dirichlet case, the vacuum polarization charge density vanishes at the boundary, whereas it attains its maximum there for Neumann boundary conditions. At a critical field strength, the vacuum polarization diverges for Neumann boundary conditions, an effect due to the instability of the lowest energy mode in the presence of the external field.},

  abstract    = {We prove that the ground state for the Dirac equation on Minkowski space in static, smooth external potentials satisfies the Hadamard condition. We show that it follows from a condition on the support of the Fourier transform of the corresponding positive frequency solution. Using a Krein space formalism, we establish an analogous result in the Klein-Gordon case for a wide class of smooth potentials. Finally, we investigate overcritical potentials, i.e. which admit no ground states. It turns out, that numerous Hadamard states can be constructed by mimicking the construction of ground states, but this leads to a naturally distinguished one only under more restrictive assumptions on the potentials.},

  abstract     = {We review different definitions of the current density for quantized fermions in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. Several deficiencies in the popular prescription due to Schwinger and the mode sum formula for static external potentials are pointed out. We argue that Dirac's method, which is the analog of the Hadamard point-splitting employed in quantum field theory in curved space-times, is conceptually the most satisfactory. As a concrete example, we discuss vacuum polarization and the stress-energy tensor for massless fermions in 1+1 dimension. Also a general formula for the vacuum polarization in static external potentials in 3+1 dimensions is derived.},
